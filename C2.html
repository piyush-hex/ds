    <h1>Chapter 2 – Number System & Conversion Boolean Logic</h1>
    <p>The number system is a fundamental concept in computer science, representing data in various formats, such as binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. The binary system, which uses only two digits (0 and 1), is the foundation of all computer operations, as it aligns with the on/off states of electronic circuits. Conversion between these number systems is essential for understanding how data is processed and manipulated within a computer. Boolean logic, developed by mathematician George Boole, is another critical aspect of computer science, providing a framework for reasoning about true and false values. It employs logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to perform operations on binary values, forming the basis for digital circuit design and programming. Together, number systems and Boolean logic enable computers to perform complex calculations and make decisions based on logical conditions..</p>

            <h2 id="bold">Introduction to Boolean Algebra</h2>
            <p>Developed by mathematician George Boole in the mid-1800s, Boolean Algebra provides a formal framework for reasoning about logical statements and their relationships. It is widely used in computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematical logic.</p>

            <h3 id="bold">Basic Operations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AND Operation (·):</strong> The result is true if both operands are true. Example: A · B = 1 only if A = 1 and B = 1.</li>
                <li><strong>OR Operation (+):</strong> The result is true if at least one operand is true. Example: A + B = 1 if A = 1 or B = 1.</li>
                <li><strong>NOT Operation (¬):</strong> The result is the inverse of the operand. Example: ¬A = 1 if A = 0.</li>

            <h3 id="bold">Truth Tables</h3>
            <p>Truth tables are used to represent the output of Boolean operations based on all possible input combinations. Below is an example of a truth table for the AND operation:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>A</th>
                    <th>B</th>
                    <th>A · B</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>

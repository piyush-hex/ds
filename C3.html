    <h1>Chapter 3 – Computer Software & Operating System</h1>
    <p>Computer software refers to the collection of programs and applications that instruct a computer on how to perform specific tasks. It can be categorized into system software, which includes operating systems (OS), and application software, which serves end-user needs. The operating system is a crucial component of any computer system, acting as an intermediary between the user and the hardware. It manages system resources, facilitates file management, and provides a user interface, allowing users to interact with the computer effectively. Popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, each offering unique features and capabilities. The development of software has transformed the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves, making it an essential aspect of modern technology.</p>

            <h2 i>Types of Software</h2>
            <h3 id="bold">1. System Software</h3>
            <p>System software is designed to manage and control computer hardware and provide a platform for running application software. The most significant type of system software is the operating system (OS).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operating System (OS):</strong> The OS is the core software that manages hardware resources, provides a user interface, and facilitates communication between hardware and software. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Drivers:</strong> These are specialized programs that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices, such as printers, graphics cards, and storage devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Utility programs perform maintenance tasks for the computer, such as virus scanning, disk management, and file management.</li>
            </ul>
</div> <div class="card">
            <h3 id="bold">2. Application Software</h3>
            <p>Application software is designed to help users perform specific tasks. It can be categorized into various types based on its functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Productivity Software:</strong> Includes word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software (e.g., Microsoft Office, Google Workspace).</li>
                <li><strong>Database Software:</strong> Used to create and manage databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle).</li>
                <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Software for accessing the internet (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics Software:</strong> Used for creating and editing images (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, GIMP).</li>
                <li><strong>Games:</strong> Software designed for entertainment purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bold">Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>The operating system is a crucial component of computer software that manages hardware and software resources. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.</p>

            <h3 id="bold">Functions of an Operating System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> The OS manages processes in the system, including scheduling, execution, and termination of processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> It allocates and deallocates memory space as needed by different applications and processes.</li>
                <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> The OS manages files on storage devices, including file creation, deletion, and access permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> It controls and coordinates the use of hardware devices through device drivers.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> The OS provides a user interface, which can be command-line based or graphical, allowing users to interact with the computer.</li>
            </ul>
</div> <div class="card">
            <h3 id="bold">Types of Operating Systems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batch Operating Systems:</strong> Execute batches of jobs without user interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-Sharing Operating Systems:</strong> Allow multiple users to access the computer simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Operating Systems:</strong> Manage a group of independent computers and make them appear as a single coherent system.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Operating Systems:</strong> Provide immediate processing and response to input, often used in embedded systems.</li>
            </ul>

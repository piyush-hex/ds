    <h1>Chapter 7 – Multimedia</h1>
    <p>Web technology encompasses the tools and languages used to create and maintain websites and web applications. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are foundational technologies for web development. HTML provides the structure of a webpage, using a series of elements and tags to define content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It allows developers to create a semantic layout that browsers can interpret and display. CSS, on the other hand, is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements, enabling developers to apply styles, colors, fonts, and responsive designs that enhance the user experience. Together, HTML and CSS form the backbone of web design, allowing developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that are accessible across various devices and screen sizes..</p>

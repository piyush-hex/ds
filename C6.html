            <h1>Introduction to Web Development</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Web development</strong> is the process of building and
                maintaining websites. It involves front-end development (client-side),
                back-end development (server-side), and database management. Front-end
                development focuses on the user interface and user experience, while
                back-end development handles server-side logic, databases, and
                application functionality. Web development is a dynamic field that
                requires knowledge of various programming languages, frameworks, and
                tools.

<h2 id="bold">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It consists of a series of elements that define the content and layout of a webpage.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;/img&gt;and &lt;input&gt directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt and &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

      <div class="card">  <h2 id="bold">What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a webpage.CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

        <p>Here are examples of the syntax for various HTML elements:</p>

&lt;p&gt ;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>
        <h3>Unordered List</h3>
        <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
        </pre>
        <h3>Ordered List</h3>
        <pre>
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;

        <h2 id="bold">History of HTML and CSS</h2>
       <pre> CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[24] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS. 

Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.

As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.
